# Coral Fluorescence project 
 The Coral Fluorescence project is designed to study corals. It is associated with a UNE class in coral biology and a survey in Belize.
 There are several sections of activities
##  Redesign Process for multispectral camera

##  Post Processing of pictures from the camera (color correction,lens corection,color measurement)

##  Software used (python,agisoft,lightroom,photoshop)

##  3D Modeling (Survey techniques and 3D model creation)

##  Coral Fluorescence (Science and research on Coral health and Fluorescence)

---------- Example Activities -------------------------------------------

Upgrade the camera to add features like a display and improved data management.
Create and improve methodology for 3D mapping coral structures. 
Additional requirements: 
Raw picture files
Color correction system
Multispectral Fluorescence excitation and emissions filters. 
Water proof
Removable battery and USB Drive
Photogrammetry software (Agisoft,Lightroom,Photoshop)
